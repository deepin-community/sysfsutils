1. Introduction
---------------

This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that
provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful
interface, we've decided to provide a stable programming interface
that will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system devices
and their attributes.

This package currently includes:

- libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
- systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
	and topology.
- A number of example usage routines in the "test" directory.
- A comprehensive testsuite, also shipped as part of the "test" directory. This
	testsuite can be used to test _all_ the APIs exported by Libsysfs.
	Please refer the libsysfs.txt file in the "docs" directory for
	details as to how to use the testsuite.


2. How to Install
-----------------

Run the "configure" script to generate Makefiles. Use "make" to build the
library and utilities.

For a successful install, run "make install" as super-user. "make uninstall"
will clean up all installed files.
